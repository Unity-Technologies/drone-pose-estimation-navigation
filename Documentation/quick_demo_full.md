# Pick-and-Place with Object Pose Estimation: Quick Demo

âŒ› _Expected completion time: 25-35 minutes_

If you just want to run the completed project, this section can help you get up and running quickly. Here, we provide a pre-trained pose estimation model for you to use, and assume a Docker workflow. By the end of this quick demo, you will be able to perform pose estimation and navigation in Unity with machine learning-based perception. To learn how to build something like this from scratch, see our [full tutorial](1_create_unity_project_with_unity_packages.md).

## Prerequisites

You will first need to **clone** this repository. 

1. Open a new terminal and set yourself where you want to host the repository and run the following command: 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Unity-Technologies/drone-pose-estimation-navigation.git
```

2. [Install Unity `2020.3.*`.](install_unity.md)

## <a name='setup'>Setup</a>

1. Open the completed project. In the Unity Hub, click the `Add` button, and select `drone-pose-estimation-navigation/PoseEstimationNavigationDemoProject` from inside the file location where you cloned the repo. 

2. Open the scene. Go to `Assets/Scenes` and double click on `TutorialDronePoseEstimationNagivation`. 

3. We now need to set the size of the images used. In the ***Game*** view, click on the dropdown menu in front of `Display 1`. Then, click **+** to create a new preset. Make sure `Type` is set to `Fixed Resolution`. Set `Width` to `650` and `Height` to `400`. The gif below depicts these actions.

## Add the Pose Estimation Model

1. Download the [pose estimation model](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/drone-pose-estimation-navigation/releases/download/v0.6.0/Drone_pose_estimation_model.tar) we have trained.

2. Go inside the `inference` folder and copy the `Drone_pose_estimation_model.tar` file you just downloaded into this folder.


## Set Up the Unity Side
