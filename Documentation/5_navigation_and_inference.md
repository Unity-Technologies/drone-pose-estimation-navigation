# Object Pose Estimation Tutorial: Part 4


In [Part 1](1_create_unity_project_with_unity_packages.md) of the tutorial, we learned how to create our Scene in Unity Editor. In [Part 2](2_set_up_the_scene_for_data_collection.md), we set up the Scene for data collection.
In [Part 3](3_data_collection_model_training.md) we have learned: 
* How to collect the data 
* How to train the deep learning model
In [Part 4](4_setup_grpc_connection.md), we have learned how to setup the grpc connection to communicate between our python model and our Unity environment.   
In this part, we are going to learn how to integrate NavMesh into our Unity environment in order to perform the drone navigation (path planning and objects avoidance).
