We used Unity's [Navigation and Pathfinding](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Navigation.html) system that allows intelligent navigation of characters in the game world. This system uses navigation meshes that are automatically created from the scene geometry, called [NavMesh](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AI.NavMesh.html). More information on how we set up our NavMesh can be found [here](Documentation/1_set_up_navmesh.md)

The navigation system allows you to create characters that can intelligently move around the game world, using navigation meshes that are created automatically from your Scene geometry. Dynamic obstacles allow you to alter the navigation of the characters at runtime, while off-mesh links let you build specific actions like opening doors or jumping down from a ledge. This section describes Unityâ€™s navigation and pathfinding systems in detail.
 
We extended NavMesh AI to our 3D path planning, by instantiating a plane at runtime that stretches from the estimated drone position to the estimated target position. We then bake a new navmesh based this plane and object colliders that exist in the scene. This allows us to maneuver the drone to the target while performing reasonable collision avoidance, to the extent that Navmesh allows.
